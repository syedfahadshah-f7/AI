# **Comparison of Search Algorithms**  

## **Pathways and Costs**  

| **Algorithm** | **Path** | **Cost** | **Optimal?** |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **UCS** | Arad → Sibiu → Rimnicu Vilcea → Pitesti → Bucharest | **418** | ✅ Yes |
| **BFS** | Arad → Sibiu → Fagaras → Bucharest | 450 | ❌ No |
| **GBFS** | Arad → Sibiu → Fagaras → Bucharest | 450 | ❌ No |
| **DFS** | Arad → Zerind → Oradea → Sibiu → Rimnicu Vilcea → Craiova → Pitesti → Bucharest | 762 | ❌ No |

## **Analysis**  

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** provides the optimal solution with the least cost (418).  
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)** and **Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)** find the same path, but they are not cost-efficient.  
- **Depth First Search (DFS)** follows a long and inefficient route, resulting in the highest cost (762).  

## **Conclusion**  
Among all algorithms, **UCS is the best** as it guarantees the optimal path with the lowest cost. BFS and GBFS provide a feasible path but are suboptimal. DFS is the least effective due to its deep exploration strategy.
