# **Comparison of Search Algorithms**  

## **Problem Statement**  
The goal is to compare different pathfinding algorithms—Breadth First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), and Depth First Search (DFS)—to determine which finds the most optimal path from **Arad** to **Bucharest** in a weighted graph.  

## **Pathways and Costs**  

| **Algorithm** | **Path** | **Cost** | **Optimal?** |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **UCS** | Arad → Sibiu → Rimnicu Vilcea → Pitesti → Bucharest | **418** | ✅ Yes |
| **BFS** | Arad → Sibiu → Fagaras → Bucharest | 450 | ❌ No |
| **GBFS** | Arad → Sibiu → Fagaras → Bucharest | 450 | ❌ No |
| **DFS** | Arad → Zerind → Oradea → Sibiu → Rimnicu Vilcea → Craiova → Pitesti → Bucharest | 762 | ❌ No |

## **Analysis**  

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** provides the optimal solution with the least cost (418).  
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)** and **Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)** find the same path, but they are not cost-efficient.  
- **Depth First Search (DFS)** follows a long and inefficient route, resulting in the highest cost (762).  

## **Conclusion**  
Among all algorithms, **UCS is the best** as it guarantees the optimal path with the lowest cost. BFS and GBFS provide a feasible path but are suboptimal. DFS is the least effective due to its deep exploration strategy.
